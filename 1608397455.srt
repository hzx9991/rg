1
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,976
You have arrived at your destination

2
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,104

12
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703

16
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,239
We've been cold to response cancellation of a passenger alarm in this vehicle

17
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:10,847
I'm sorry this has been a misunderstanding

18
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367

She has accepted an offer the lift home from ISO

23
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
If we could go

24
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,959
Well I didn't do anything anyway

25
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:15,615
I'll need to get a new connect to your console to unlock the car and then you can be on your way

26
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
It'll take a few minutes

27
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
They're going

28
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:52,223

Close proximity to the vehicle

57
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
Don't give me about you.

58
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:42,463
Don't you

59
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
What do you want from me

60
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119

00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,503
No cat

64
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
No one needs to know Charlie

65
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Not even your wife

66
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
Pretty stupid but I got lost in the moment

67
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543

00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
